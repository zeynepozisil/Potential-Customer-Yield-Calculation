### A game company wants to create level-based new customer definitions (personas) by using some measurable features of its customers, and to create segments according to these new customer definitions and to estimate how much the new customers can earn on average according to these segments.

### Example scenario: We want to determine how much a 25-year-old woman from Turkey using IOS can earn on average for the company.

### Using the personas we created as part of this project plays an important role in increasing net income and/or profit.
